<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
The introduction of Open AI’s ChatGPT-4 Chatbot in 2023 marked a milestone in the widespread public adoption and attention of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Its capabilities shocked many: a user-friendly AI Chatbot that could write code and essays at the level of a smart high school student. For the first time, an accessible generative AI system was deemed useful for daily tasks, such as drafting emails and summarising documents (Aschenbrenner, 2024). This new way of interacting with AI as a daily helper marked a societal shift in the creation and sharing of knowledge (Marr, 2023; Foote, 2024).

It has contributed to the further democratisation and personalisation of information and online experiences, but also eased the spread of misinformation easier and produced opaque, if not completely misaligned outputs (Brown, 2024). Equally, new jobs have been created with its evolution, and productivity gains achieved, while providing new avenues for education. Conversely, the uneven distribution of these benefits in society has led to an ever-increasing digital divide (Capraro et al., 2023). With generative AI contributing both to ameliorating and exacerbating pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities (Capraro et al., 2024), it has been challenging for policy makers to legislate and protect citizens from the discriminatory aspects of AI. This is because it produces both opportunities and challenges to their nations, but in any case has far reaching implications on different aspects of society (Dwivedi et al, 2023). 

<p align="justify">  
The first AI law globally, the EU AI Act, takes a risk-based approach to AI with particularly strict rules on General Purpose AI, like ChatGPT, and focusing on transparency, accountability, ethical AI development through the inclusion of fundamental rights, privacy and non-discrimination (EU Parliament, 2023). However, as countries themselves are implementing generative AI in their policy-making and administrative tasks, such as the UK, Latvia and Austria (Council of Europe, 2023), existing policy frameworks fail to fully confront the risks associated with commercial-competitive AI Chatbots - leaving citizens vulnerable.
